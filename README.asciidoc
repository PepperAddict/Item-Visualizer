= Item Visualizer 

Welcome to Item Visualizer

Item Visualizer is a Monday View app to help explain your item better with various methods you could choose from. 

I am PepperAddict and I am a fullstack developer who enjoys working remotely. 
A question I keep asking is: “How can I get my team to understand me better?” 

This Monday app should help solve that without a separate software or service.

To start this app make sure you:
